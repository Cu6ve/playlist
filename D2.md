MVP ( Minimum Viable Product)
As a group, we are going to makesure that we keep the app very simple for our actors to use and then build up from there.
We will do a lot of testing and make sure that we are pushing code that is functional to the GitHub Repository. 
We want to a make sure we keep track of who is doing what so we can have an easier way to track issues back to the creator. 
For our requirements we will make sure that we start with the requirements that matter most to us to integrate into the application and then if 
we have the time and energy and we will work on the  complex features in our application.
